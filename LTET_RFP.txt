Executive Summary Larsen & Toubro (L&T), a global leader in engineering, construction, and technology, administers a comprehensive portfolio of 14 major employee welfare schemes that span across all Independent Companies (ICs) of L&T through the L&T Employee Trust (LTET). These schemes are structured into three key categories — Medical, Education and Skill building (Sports and Vocational) — aimed at holistically supporting employees, retirees, and their families. Eligibility for these schemes includes permanent employees, retired personnel, and eligible dependents, as defined by the LTET’s policy guidelines. Currently, the administration of these schemes is managed through legacy systems and disparate approval mechanisms, leading to operational inefficiencies, processing delays, and limited data visibility. With a potential user base of approximately 600,000 beneficiaries across the L&T ecosystem, it’s time to rethink and modernize this landscape. To address this, LTET is launching a strategic transformation initiative to build a centralized, digital LTET platform. This unified system will deliver transparent, role-based access for all stakeholders — including employees, retirees, approvers, finance, and administrators — while ensuring seamless application, processing, tracking, and disbursement workflows. This Request for Proposal (RFP) invites qualified vendors to deliver a secure, scalable, and intelligent platform that supports rule-based automation, AI-driven eligibility recommendations, real-time dashboards, and robust governance controls. This transformation also lays the foundation for a future roadmap that includes predictive analytics, self-service insights, periodic scheme reviews based on usage data, and potential expansion of scheme offerings as employee needs evolve. 2. Project Objectives & Business Goals 2.1 Key Objectives The current LTET scheme management process is supported by an existing legacy system used by employees and approvers. However, this system lacks modern capabilities and does not fully align with current industry standards in terms of user experience, automation, and operational efficiency. Limitations such as fragmented workflows, restricted configurability, minimal self-service, and LTET RFP insufficient tracking features result in delayed responses, increased manual effort, and a subpar experience for users across roles. To overcome these challenges, the LTET Digital Platform aims to deliver a seamless, intuitive, and modern experience for all categories of users — employees, retirees, approvers, administrators, finance teams, and leadership. It will simplify access, enhance transparency, automate repetitive processes, and empower stakeholders with tools for smart decision-making and real-time visibility. The key objectives include: • Develop a centralized digital portal for all LTET-related services and schemes. • Enable role-based profile for Employees/Retirees, Approvers, and Administrators. • Simplify scheme discovery and submission process using guided workflows and smart filtering. • Ensure transparency by allowing applicants to track their claim status in real-time. • Improve processing time and accuracy through rule-based automation and document validation. • Provide LTET admins with the ability to configure schemes, manage rules, and generate reports. • Ensure platform scalability, security, and accessibility to meet L&T’s digital transformation standards. 2.2 Strategic Outcomes The digital transformation of the LTET platform will drive the following business outcomes: • Enhance current employee and retiree satisfaction through simplified access and improved claim submission & tracking process. • Improve operational efficiency by reducing manual work, paper-based dependencies, and approval delays. • Provide approvers with a streamlined, transparent process and intelligent prompts to aid decision-making. • Enable the finance teams with automated payment workflows, real-time reconciliation tracking, and comprehensive reports for audits, tax compliance, and disbursement accuracy. • Enable administrators to monitor scheme utilization, track bottlenecks, and optimize programs based on data. • Ensure alignment with L&T’s broader IT modernization roadmap and reinforce its position as a digitally mature organization. • Lay the foundation for future AI-based automation, predictive analytics, and digital outreach to beneficiaries. LTET RFP 3.
